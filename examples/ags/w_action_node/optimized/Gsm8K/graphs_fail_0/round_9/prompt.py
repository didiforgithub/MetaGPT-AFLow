"""

SOLUTION_METHOD_CHECK = """
Analyze the given mathematical problem and determine if it requires multiple solution methods or approaches. Answer with 'Yes' if multiple methods could be beneficial, or 'No' if a single straightforward approach is sufficient.

Consider the following factors:
1. Problem complexity
2. Potential for alternative solution strategies
3. Opportunity for cross-verification of results

Provide your answer as either 'Yes' or 'No', followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning.
"""

BEST_SOLUTION_SELECTION = """
Given a mathematical problem and multiple solution approaches, evaluate each solution and select the best one. Consider the following criteria:

1. Correctness: Is the solution mathematically accurate?
2. Clarity: Is the solution easy to understand and follow?
3. Efficiency: Does the solution use an optimal approach?
4. Completeness: Does the solution address all aspects of the problem?

Analyze each provided solution against these criteria. Then, select the best overall solution or synthesize a new solution combining the strongest elements from multiple approaches. Provide your reasoning for the selection or synthesis.

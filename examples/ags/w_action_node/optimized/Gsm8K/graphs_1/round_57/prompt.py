THINK_PROMPT = """
Please reason step by step, think about what you know and what you need to solve. After your initial thoughts, ask yourself two critical questions about the problem that could lead to a deeper understanding or reveal potential solution approaches. Then, answer these questions to the best of your ability.

Now, take a moment to reflect on your thinking process:
1. What assumptions have you made?
2. Are there any alternative perspectives you haven't considered?
3. How might you challenge your initial approach?

Based on this reflection, refine your thought process and provide a final, comprehensive analysis of the problem.
"""

REPHRASE_PROMPT = """
Please rephrase the given problem in a different way, maintaining its core meaning but potentially revealing new aspects or approaches to solve it.
